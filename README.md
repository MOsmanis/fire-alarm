# Fire Alarm

The apartment building I live in has very sensitive smoke detectors in apartments that are rented out to short-term tenants, which trigger a very loud alarm in the whole building. 
This has caused hour-long alarm sessions, including wakign up from sleep because somebody left the humidifier on during the night. Usually travellers are confused on what to do and just wait it out.

This web app informs the foreigners about what to do during a fire alarm and allows to leave a message in case it is a 100% false alarm.
